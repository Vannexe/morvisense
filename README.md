# Morvi Sensé

A gesturally controlled generative instrument, designed for use as an M4L device within Ableton Live. 

## Latest updates
1.0 - November 2024 - _Introducing the Morvi Sensé_


## Hardware requirements
A laptop running Ableton with a camera, and a game controller are required. MIDI controllers can be used additionally alongside the game controller. 



## Installation/Setup
Before running the M4L device, disable the xbox game bar shortcut (so as to be able to use the generative features of the instrument).

Make sure that Max points to the entire folder by going to ```Options - File Preferences - (+) icon```, and  locate the parent folder that has been installed from the repository. 

Make sure the controller(s) and headphones/speakers are plugged in BEFORE opening the device. 



## UI

Pressing the Map button/ the button to the right of the gesture sets the device into mapping mode - click on any parameter to be controlled in Ableton Live. The range of gestural control can be controlled by the two percentage values respectively. To cancel a mapping, hit the cross icon. 

To switch between Looping and Generative modes, hit the button to the left of the Looping/Generative display, or hit the xbox button on the controller.



## Game Controller - Basic Controls

The 8 main buttons (Y, B, A, X, 8) are mapped to the 8 notes of the minor scale. Press the joysticks (1) to switch the root note of the scale. Press (3) and (6) to switch octaves. Hold (2) and (7) to temporarily switch octaves. (2) and (7) also double up as sustain buttons - press and hold onto one of the 8 buttons (Y, B, A, X or 8), press (2) or (7) at the same time, and let go of the held of the 8 buttons. The note is sustained. 

To release all held notes, show a thumbs down gesture in front of the camera. If done successfully, you will feel a vibration on your controller in response.


## Looping Mode
If not in looping mode, press the xbox button (5) or the button to the left of the looping display on the M4L device to switch into looping mode. 

Quickly hit and let go of the right trigger to start countdown. Countdown runs for one bar, followed by recording length. Input notes, either via game controller or MIDI controller. After the recording length, looping automatically starts. Haptic feedback is used for the metronome.

Standard recording length is 1 bar at 120 bpm. Push the right joystick left and right to change bar length. Push the left joystick up and down to change tempo. Push the left joystick left and right for smaller tempo changes.

Hit and let go of the right trigger again to stop.


## Generative Mode
Hit the xbox button (5) or the button to the left of the looping display on the M4L device to switch into generative mode.

This mode is completely adaptive. Start playing notes, either on controller or on MIDI device. The model will automatically pick notes up and start a generative output. 

Push the left joystick (1) up and down to change the density of notes outputted by the model. 

Press (5) again to exit generative mode.
