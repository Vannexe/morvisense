A gesturally controlled instrument - all using a game controller and a laptop. 


## Installation/Setup

On installation, run the gamecontroller-face.maxpat file. 

Before running file, disable the xbox game bar shortcut (so as to be able to use the generative features of the instrument).

Little bug that I'm still working on - make sure the controller and headphones/speakers are plugged in BEFORE opening gamecontroller-face.maxpat.
